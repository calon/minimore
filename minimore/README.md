Minimore is a clean and mininal style WordPress theme that based on Leo Babauta's [mnmlist v1](http://mnmlist.com/theme), which .

The original mnmlist theme has no widgets, comments, search form, etc. Most theme user have to add them by self.
So I take them back, reduced some unnecessary functions, maintaining the minimal clean style.
Then, I'll try to make this theme to follow WordPress theme review standards.

Minimore theme is under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net), you can do anything you want.
Thank you for using it.

Basic Setup
---------------------------------
1. Upload entire folder to /wp-content/themes/minimore
2. Go to WordPress dashboard panel, Appearance, Themes, Manage Themes.
3. Activate minimore theme.

or upload the Zip archive in Install panel, then click "install now" button.

If you turn off the widget feature, you'd better replace the sample about info in sidebar.php to your own.
