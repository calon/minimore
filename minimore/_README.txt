mnmlist is a clean and very minimalist theme that focuses on the content without distractions. It has a single sidebar. No widgets. No comments. No search. No dynamic sidebar. No nothing.

This theme is "as is" - any bugs, you need to fix it. Any changes you want, you'll need to make them.

This theme is designed to be as minimalist as possible, so I've stripped out a lot of functions that other themes have. That's the choice I've made and I like it that way.

Again, there are no comments. You'll need to add these in to the theme if you want them. It's not that hard -- just copy comments php files and code from other themes, and add it to this theme.

This theme is uncopyrighted -- use as you like, spread it, sell it, do whatever you want. Thanks and enjoy.



Basic Setup
---------------------------------
You'll need to edit several pages in the Wordpress theme editor - go to Wordpress admin, then Appearance, then editor (after you've activated this theme).

- Sidebar
You'll want to customize this to have the links you want, and your RSS and email subscription urls (or just delete these links if you don't want them).

- Footer
Right now, there's an "uncopyright" link, but it will go to my uncopyright page. Create your own, or put a copyright notice here, or whatever links you want.

- Header
Right now, it's set to put your blog's title and subtitle in the header. You might want to change the font, size and color of this title in the style.css file -- change the #header h1 and h2 styles. Feel free to use an image with your logo, as I do on http://mnmlist.com, or whatever you like.
